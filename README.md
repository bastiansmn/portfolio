# Portfolio
## Bastian Somon

This is my portfolio idea (September 2021)
You can find 4 sections :
- Home : Small landing section 
- About : Who am I, what am I studying, ...
- Work : My personal or university projects. All are pretty much my own thinking during the entire project.
- Contact : Everything you need to contact me.

# How to run the project :

Since I don't post my portfolio on the web (for the moment), 
you need to run it in order to see the site.
Luckily, I used Vite.JS (with Vue.JS obviously) so it's pretty fast to run it from scratch.
First just clone the project.
Then run :
```bash
npm i
```

To install dependencies.
Then :
```bash
npm run dev
```

And you click on the link Vite will give you.
